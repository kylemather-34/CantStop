TEST PLAN - Dice:

In order to meet requirements, we want to ensure that all the requirements are met;
namely that the dice can produce numbers randomly from 1..6. Lastly,
we must ensure that the destructor works for the die. The test for all numbers from 1..6
involves running the program several times and outputting the die values to a text file and
checking that all values were met and inside the proper range. The destructor, if successful,
will not produce any errors upon running the program.

TEST PLAN - Player:

In order to meet requirements for Player, we must ensure the following:
1. The constructor can successfully create an instance of the Player class
with all the proper data members.
2. The color() function can return the test Players' colors.
3. The score() function can return the test Players' scores.
4. The wonColumn() function can return a boolean value according to the column number.
The plan is to create a test Player, call the color() and score() functions and print them to
Output.txt. We will also call the wonColumn() function three times, two of which should return false
and the last should return true.
