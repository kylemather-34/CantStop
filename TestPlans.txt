TEST PLAN - Dice:

In order to meet requirements, we want to ensure that all the requirements are met;
namely that the dice can produce numbers randomly from 1..6. Lastly,
we must ensure that the destructor works for the die. The test for all numbers from 1..6
involves running the program several times and outputting the die values to a text file and
checking that all values were met and inside the proper range. The destructor, if successful,
will not produce any errors upon running the program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEST PLAN - Player:

In order to meet requirements for Player, we must ensure the following:
1. The constructor can successfully create an instance of the Player class
with all the proper data members.
2. The color() function can return the test Players' colors.
3. The score() function can return the test Players' scores.
4. The wonColumn() function can return a boolean value according to the column number.
The plan is to create a test Player, call the color() and score() functions and print them to
Output.txt. We will also call the wonColumn() function three times, two of which should return false
and the last should return true.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEST PLAN - Column:
In order to meet requirements for Column, we must ensure the following:
1. The constructor initializes the column correctly.
2. The state() function returns the correct state of the column.
3. The startTower() function places a tower in a column.
4. The move() function moves a tower within the column.
5. The stop() function ends a player's turn and updates the column correctly.
6. The print() function displays the correct column state.
The getMarkerPositions() function returns the correct marker positions in the column.
The plan is to create a test Column, call all of these functions on it, and print it to both the
console and Output.txt

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEST PLAN - Game:
In order to meet requirements for the Game module, we must ensure the following:

Constructor Initialization:

Verify that the Game constructor correctly initializes all members, including the Dice, Player objects, and Column objects.
Check that the fourDice array is allocated properly and contains valid Dice objects.
Dice Rolling:

Ensure that the roll() function works properly for all dice in the fourDice array.
The dice should return random values between 1 and 6, and the values should be stored in rVal.
Player Initialization:

Confirm that the getNewPlayer() function correctly gathers input from the user and assigns a player name and color.
Validate that the player is initialized with the correct name, color, and score.
Ensure the player input is case-insensitive and defaults to blue when an invalid color is entered.
Column Initialization:

Verify that the Column objects cOne and cTwo are created with the correct number of spaces (2 and 7, respectively).
Ensure that the Column objects correctly initialize their internal state and marker positions.
Tower Placement:

Test the startTower() function by placing a tower in Column 2 (7-length column) and verify that the column state changes as expected.
Ensure the getMarkerPositions() function correctly reflects the updated marker positions after a tower is placed.
Tower Movement:

Confirm that the move() function properly moves a tower within the column.
Verify that the marker positions update accordingly after the tower is moved.
Stopping the Column:

Test the stop() function by ending a player's turn and ensure that the column's state is updated correctly.
Verify that the getMarkerPositions() function returns the correct state after the column is stopped.
Printing Column State:

Test the print() function to ensure that the column's state is correctly printed.
The column state should reflect the final state after all actions (startTower, move, stop) have been performed.
Overall Integration Test:

Integrate all these functionalities in the testGame() function.
Verify that the printed output, including dice rolls, player initialization, column state, tower placement, movement, and stopping, is correct.
Ensure that the output is written to both the console and the "Output.txt" file.
The plan is to create a test Game, call all of these functions, and print the results to both the console and "Output.txt".

TEST PLAN - Board

Objective:

Ensure that the Board class and its interactions with the Game class function correctly. This includes initialization, dice rolling, player setup, column state management, tower placement, movement, stopping, and output verification.

Test Cases:

1. Board Initialization

Objective: Verify that the Board constructor correctly initializes all column objects.

Expected Outcome:

All columns (2-12) should be initialized correctly.

getColumn(i) != nullptr for valid indices.

2. Dice Rolling

Objective: Ensure that the roll() function generates valid dice values.

Expected Outcome:

Each die in game.getDice() rolls a value between 1 and 6.

Values should be stored and retrievable via operator<<.

3. Player Initialization

Objective: Verify that Player objects are initialized correctly.

Expected Outcome:

game.getPlayerOne() and game.getPlayerTwo() should have valid attributes.

print() function outputs the correct player details.

4. Column Initialization

Objective: Validate that the Board columns are initialized properly.

Expected Outcome:

Each column should exist and be in the expected initial state.

5. Tower Placement in Column 7

Objective: Test the startTower() function for a valid column.

Steps:

Call startTower(&game.getPlayerOne()) on column 7.

Retrieve marker positions with getMarkerPositions().

Expected Outcome:

startTower() should return true if successful.

getMarkerPositions() should reflect the initial placement.

6. Tower Movement in Column 7

Objective: Ensure that the move() function operates correctly.

Steps:

Call move() on column 7.

Retrieve updated marker positions.

Expected Outcome:

move() should return true if movement occurs.

getMarkerPositions() should update accordingly.

7. Stopping a Column

Objective: Verify the behavior of stop() function when a column is halted.

Steps:
