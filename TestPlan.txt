TEST PLAN:

In order to meet requirements, we want to ensure that all the requirements are met;
namely that the dice can produce numbers randomly from 1..6. Lastly,
we must ensure that the destructor works for the die. The test for all numbers from 1..6
involves running the program several times and outputting the die values to a text file and
checking that all values were met and inside the proper range. The destructor, if successful,
will not produce any errors upon running the program.
